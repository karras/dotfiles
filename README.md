# Dotfiles

Nothing special, simply my dotfiles for everyday use.

## Features

The following configurations are covered:

* Background images
* Environment variables
* Git
* GNUPG
* Greetd
* GTK 3.0
* Neovim
* Terminator
* Waybar
* Wayfire
* XDG user directories
* ZSH

## Dependencies

The dotfiles are managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

## Usage

* Install all dotfiles:
  ```sh
  make install
  ```

* Deploy the additional files in the `[_global][./_global] directory manually
  as they are not managed by Stow
